Not sure about the mix of humidity/wind speed for the single column; all of these were determined by me
"Name coded as ""CD"" is difficult to distinguish"
7/28/2023 log some humid supposed to be hi_wc??
"Sanders and Sander, J the same person? Sanders in both print and cursive"
"Name coded as ""Spencer"" is difficult to distinguish -- could also just be another Sanders signature?"
"Keller, A signature in print and cursive"
7/27/2023 logs could be decimals but could also be scan remnants
