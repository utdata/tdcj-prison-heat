title: "TDCJ Prison Heat"
---

This is for a group project under UT's Media Innovation Group. 

It is an examination of recorded and actual temperatures in jails across the state of Texas using documents obtained through the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and National Weather Service data. More extensive sourcing information can be found on the project's cleaning files.

Looking at the navigation of this site, you'll mainly want to look at the files under the Analysis heading.

## July 2025 goals

Protocols

- Which units and dates were under precautionary measures (within our log data range)?
- Which units/dates should've been under precationary measures given TDCH rules?
    - Where are our gaps in this knowledge?
- What is the difference between those units/dates?

Indoor

> Not tackled yet. Check the questions?

- What was the temperature inside on the days that were under protocol?
- Are there days where inside a prison it was hotter than on the hottest day under protocol?
- How many days were above 85 degrees inside? 95? 100?


## Outdoor logs

Lauren McGaughey of the Texas Newsroom public radio collaborative acquired through a public information request the outdoor temperature logs kept by Texas prisons. The logs are hand-written and the data could not be accurately pulled from them using AI, so a group of Media Innovation Group fellows transcribed about a week of logs for each prison, from July 24, 2023 through July 31, 2023.

We wanted to explore several angles:

- How well are the logs kept?
    - Are the legible and accurate?
    - Are they accurate?

Here is what we found:

### Basics and legibility

**May 2025**

- We transcribed 8 days of logs for 82 units, making up about [15,700 rows of data](02-outdoor-readability.qmd#basic-information). For some analysis we used just the last 7 days of the month.
- If we found a row of the data was corrected or there was a question about the legibility, [we included a note](02-outdoor-readability.qmd#records-with-notes) within that row. We included some consistent-worded notes so we could count them, but also had some more free-form when those categories didn't fit. These are 7-day figures. We tried to be consistent, but different humans were involved, so variability is inevitable.
    - About 15% of the records had notes.
    - About 1,300 records (7.5%) had corrections.
    - About 1,000 records (6.5%) we marked with legibility issues.
- Of those with notes, we also counted [what was at issue](02-outdoor-readability.qmd#variable-counts).    
    - There were about 650 notes concerning the heat index/wind chill column. That column is challenging because it measures two different things. Some records would also sometimes include what we determined was a heat index category, which we recorded in a separate column.
    - There were about 590 notes about the temperature column.
- We wanted to see [for which units we added notes](02-outdoor-readability.qmd#notes-by-unit).
    - More than 60% of the records for the Stevenson unit had notes, and many of those were flagged as "corrections". However, when you look at the [original document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s3pSZ7aU7lZHyKedz-P7DmVJIRmSUkSg/view?usp=drive_link), it appears the unit reviews the logs and clears up any legibility issues. The logs are also signed. i.e. having more corrections could be a positive thing.
    - In some cases we recorded an overall note about the unit as opposed to notes for each individual line. [They are printed in browsable form here](02-outdoor-readability.qmd#unit-notes).

### Precautionary measures

**July 2025 update**

Basically which units/dates should be under "precautionary measure" based on written data logs, and how does that compare to what really happened.

The first thing we wanted to do was calculate a nuanced "protocol flag" which uses the logs and TDCJ definitions and directives to define if the unit should be in "precautionary measures".

See the [Checking protocols](02-outdoor-protocols.qmd) notebook for a full discussion, but the definitions and directives are confusing.

The most restrictive definition is if units reach 105 degree temperatures for at least three hours for two consecutive days OR a heat index of 113, then units should institute precautionary measures as outlined.

Of our eight days of records from 82 prisons ...

- According to the activation data, There were 24 days in our time period where heat mitigation protocols were put in place. This includes all eight days for the Halbert and Sayle units.
- There were six "unit days" where Excessive Heat Warning conditions were in effect for more than three days during our eight-day period and in zero cases were active heat protocols in place.
- Of the 69 unit days where Excessive Heat Warning conditions were in place, only one unit went into precautionary measures, for a single day.
- There were 127 units that reached a temperature of 105 or heat index of 113 in the eight day period. Of those, there were 12 unit days in active heat mitigation, most of which were the Halbert and Sayle units.

Caveats

There are also 46 cases where the hourly `hi_wc` heat index value is blank, but the unit did include a "category" for heat index that was Cat 3 or higher. Those are potentially 113 degrees or greater and would put the day in precautionary measures territory. **As of now, these are excluded, and I'm dissatisfied with that. Perhaps we could fill those at 113?**


### Accuracy vs weather stations

**May 2025**

To guage the accuracy of recorded temperature and humidity/heat index we paired each prison unit with a "nearby" weather station so we could compare the  tempartures.

> I'd like to take another crack at pairing these weather stations and include the distance the weather station is from the prison unit. [I've found a few issues](02-outdoor-reliability.qmd#ta-missing-weather-stations), along with some solutions to them, but they've yet to be implemented. For now, consider these stats with caution.

- We don't have a good match for about 15% of the records.
- On average, temperatures are recorded [-2.9 degrees lower](02-outdoor-reliability.qmd#average-temp-difference) than the closest weather station.
- [About half](02-outdoor-reliability.qmd#percent-temp-within-range) of the temperatures are within 2 degrees, and 3/4ths are within 4 degrees.
    - You can [peruse these ranges by unit](02-outdoor-reliability.qmd#within-range-degrees-by-unit).
- The [heat index differences](02-outdoor-reliability.qmd#heat-index) are a little harder because of so much missing data, but we've charted them.

## Indoor temperatures

We do have indoor temperatures but there were a lot of changes in the other data like activations and weather so it needs to be reworked. That will have to come later.
